          <h2 class="text-center" style="margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom:50px;">How it Works</h2>

          <p>We want to see how you use the Agile development framework (build, measure, learn) and the Scientific method (observe, question, form a hypothesis, experiment, modify or accept the hypothesis) to find a problem and a solution using computer scienceâ€”a true computer scientific method.</p>

          <p>The <strong>Youth Computer Science Fair</strong> will take place from 3-5:30pm at Techfest on Friday, August 10, at the event center inside Isle Casino Cape Girardeau. It's free to enter, and junior high students (grades 7-8) and high school students (grades 9-12) as of Fall 2018 are invited to put a project together and showcase it at the Youth Computer Science Fair.</p>

          <p class="text-center"><a id="code-labs-one-details" href="#registration" style="background-color:cornflowerblue; margin-left: 5px;" class="button button-small">Sign Me Up!</a></p>

          <h3 style="border: 0; margin-top: 0; padding-top: 30px;">What You'll Need</h3>
          <p>A slide deck (Powerpoint or Google Slides presentation) detailing the problem you've identified and how you're going to solve it using technology and computer science, due July 30, 2018.</p>
        </div>

        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Judging Criteria</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Concept: How creative is your idea? Does your idea identify a specific solution?</li>
        <li>Solution: Does your solution utilize technology and computer science, with computer science being the focal point? Have potential drawbacks been identified and worked through?</li>
        <li>Process: Did you demonstrate Agile and Scientific Methodology in your project?</li>
        <li>Skill: Did the junior high student showcase an understanding of the technology used? Did the junior high student reference appropriate technology? Did the high school student show an understanding of the specific technology used to implement the solution? (Example: Outlining specific programming languages and why those were selected). Did the high school student reference appropriate technology to solve the problem?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Example Projects</h3>

      <p><strong>Junior High:</strong> An ideal project for the junior high level would be identifying that summer can be boring for kids, with a solution utilizing technology and computer science being a website that collects daily activities broken out by age group.</p>

      <p><strong>High School:</strong> An ideal project for a high school student would be identifying that summer can be boring, with a solution utilizing technology and computer science that references the specific tech used being a website that collects daily events broken out by age group, that asks you what you're interested in doing and how old you are, using specific programming languages and explaining why those specific languages were selected.</p>

      <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

      <p><strong>Can I work in a group with my friend?</strong><br />
        Sure! Prizes will be split among the team. Sharing a Nintendo Switch + Labo kit might be tough, but we'll leave that up to you.</p>

      <p><strong>What are the prizes all about?</strong><br />
        One grand prize winner will take home a Nintendo Switch + Labo kit; one first place winner will take home $100; and one second place winner will take home $50.</p>

      <p><strong>Who's judging the Youth Computer Science Fair?</strong><br />
        Local tech folks, computer programmers and developers, as well as community leaders interested in youth tech education will team up to judge projects.</p>

      <p><strong>I'm stuck. What do I do?</strong><br />
        Dig in and figure it out, and plan to come to one of two tech office hours at Codefi on the 6th floor of the Marquette Tower at 338 Broadway, where developers will provide feedback on your project on Monday June 25 from 3-4 p.m., and Monday July 16 from  3-4 p.m. Tech office hours will have no impact on final judging scores, but are an opportunity to get technical feedback on your project.</p>

      <p><strong>What happens the day of the Youth Computer Science Fair?</strong><br />
        Be at the event space at Isle Casino Cape Girardeau at 2:45 p.m. on Friday, August 10; we'll have Chromebooks and tablets set up and pre-loaded with your slide deck. Judges will go around and visit with each entrant and ask questions about your project; they've already seen your slide deck, but this is your chance to answer any questions they may have. Judging will start at 3 p.m., and the youth computer science fair goes until 5:30 p.m. Winners will be announced between 5-5:30pm, and prizes will be awarded at that time. Cookies, lemonade, and milk will be served.</p>
