            <p><small>To begin, you must complete an application. Here you will be asked a few questions about basic demographic information (e.g. name, address, DOB, etc.), as well as a few additional questions about your previous experience, and reasons for taking the class. We do not sell any of your information. Data is collected for grant reporting purposes so we can continue funding programs like these.</small></p><small></small>
            <p>Step 2:&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="codelabs-one-title">Critical Thinking Assessment</span></p><small></small>
            <p><small>After completing your application for the class, you will be emailed a brief problem-solving assessment to the email address you used to apply. You must complete this assessment before your application will be considered.</small></p><small></small>
            <p>Step 3:&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="codelabs-one-title">Decision Notification</span></p><small></small>
            <p><small>Applicants will be notified of their application status by the Decision Date specified for each course. You will be notified of your application status by that date, however you may receive notification sooner. Please do not inquire about your application unless you have not heard by that date. Applications will receive one of these decisions:</small></p><small></small>

            </p>
            <p><small>This class requires no prior programming experience, but you will need to be comfortable with computer use (using the internet, downloading software, etc). Code Labs One is intended to teach skills needed to be employable as a programmer, and is best suited for individuals who are interested in a career in tech. Students should be 18 or older. We have also found that students who succeed in the class have a solid foundation in basic math and problem solving. That is why we have developed a short Critical Thinking Assessment as a part of application process.</small>

              <br/>
              <span class="codelabs-one-title">How much time will I need to spend on the class?</span>
            </p>
            <p><small>Over the 20 weeks of class, most students will need to commit at least 20 hours per week for class and homework.</small>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p id="q3">
              <br/>
              <span class="codelabs-one-title">Do I need to own a laptop to participate in the class? If so, what are the specifications?</span></p>
            <p><small>Students will need access to a laptop to participate in the course. Unfortunately, we are unable to provide students with laptops at this time. Chromebooks and tablets will not be sufficient for use in this course. If you own a PC, you must have Windows 7 OS or more recent, though Windows 10 is strongly preferable. Please apply all system upgrades before coming to class. There are no other requirements to participate.</small>

              <span class="codelabs-one-title">How are applicants selected for the course?</span>
            </p>
            <p><small>Each student is assessed on two things:</small></p>
            <ol>
              <li><small>Aptitude for problem solving and logical reasoning.</small></li>
              <li><small>When enrolling students, we also strive to assemble a class that reflects the broader community and represents a diverse array of backgrounds.</small></li>
            </ol>

            <p id="q5">

              <span class="codelabs-one-title">Can I be admitted to the class if I donâ€™t do well on the Critical Thinking Assessment?</span></p>
            <p><small>Yes, though it is less likely. The reason we give the Critical Thinking Assessment significant weight is because it shows us how students approach new puzzles that require logical thinking, which directly relates to a studentâ€™s ability to master the material presented in the class.</small>
            </p>

              <br/>
              <span class="codelabs-one-title">Can I retake the Critical Thinking Assessment?</span></p>
            <p><small>Unfortunately, we are unable to allow applicants to retake the Assessment unless they can demonstrate that they experienced technical difficulties that prohibited them from completing it.</small>
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p id="q7">
              <br/>
              <span class="codelabs-one-title">When will I hear back about my application?</span></p>
            <p><small>Each class has a decision date, by which you will receive notification of your application status. Please do not inquire about your application unless you have not heard by that date.</small>
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p id="q8">
              <span class="codelabs-one-title">I will have to miss several classes throughout the course. Is that ok?</span></p><small></small>
            <p><small>Yes, it is okay to miss a class as long as you&nbsp;<strong>keep up with the lessons and homework&nbsp;set out in the schedule</strong>. Remember, you will need to make up any class time you miss on your own time, and you wonâ€™t have the benefit of having your classmates and Teaching Fellows right there to answer your questions. As prior students have found, once you fall behind in class, the fast pace of the curriculum means it quickly becomes very difficult to catch up again.</small>
            </p>

            <p id="q9">
              <br/>
              <span class="codelabs-one-title">Are there grades in this class? How do I pass/fail?</span></p>
            <p><small>The class is broken up into three units. There are no grades in the class, but students must complete all of the required assignments from the current Unit in order to continue to the next. Those deadlines will be made clear at the beginning of the class.</small>

              <br/>
              <span class="codelabs-one-title">Will Code Labs One get me a job if I finish this class?</span></p>
            <p><small>Code Labs One does not guarantee that we will place any student in our classes into a job. The course is designed to take participants from no programming knowledge to entry level job skills, teach participants about the industry, and introduce them to potential employers. Unit 3 of the course increases the chance that participants build a relationship with local employers but it is their sole decision to make hiring decisions during and after the course.</small>
